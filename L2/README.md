This code demonstrates how Node.js handles asynchronous operations using the **event loop**, especially for CPU-intensive or I/O tasks.

It starts by printing `"start"` and ends with `"end"`, along with calling the `fun()` function which logs `"fun"`. Then, a file (`demo.txt`) is read using `fs.readFile`. Once the file is read, it prints its content and schedules more asynchronous tasks like `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and `process.nextTick`.

* **`setImmediate`** and **`setTimeout` with 0 ms** are both used, but their execution order isn't guaranteed; it depends on the event loop phase and system state.
* **`process.nextTick()`** always runs before any `setTimeout` or `setImmediate`, even inside callbacks.
* A **Promise** is created with the `multiply` function. If `a > 10`, it resolves and logs the result (here, `66`). Promises have **microtask priority**, so they also execute before timers or immediates.

Additionally, there's a `process.nextTick()` at the end of the script that logs `"next tick"` before timers or immediates run.

In summary, this code is a great example of how **Node.js schedules tasks**: synchronous code runs first, then `nextTick`, then Promises, and then `setTimeout`/`setImmediate`â€”the order depends on the event loop phases.
